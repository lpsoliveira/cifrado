# Cifrado 0.1 - Sun 03 Mar 2013

* Uploading/downloading files and directories to OpenStack Swift.
* Asymmetric/Symmetric transparent encryption/decryption of files
  when uploading/downloading using GnuPG.
* Segmented uploads (splitting the file in multiple segments).
* Resume (unencrypted) segmented uploads. Segments already uploaded
  are not uploaded again. This feature does not work when using
  file encryption at the moment.
* Different progressbar styles. CLI does not have to be boring :).
* Bandwidth limits when uploading/downloading stuff.
* Music streaming (streams mp3/ogg files available in a container).
  and plays them using mplayer if available).
* Regular list/delete/stat commands.
* Video streaming (streams video files available in a container).
* Bootstrap a Swift All-In-One server in a cloud provider
  (DigitalOcean is the only one supported ATM).
* Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.X and 2.0 compatibility.
